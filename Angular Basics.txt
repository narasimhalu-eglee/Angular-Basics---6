Basics :
Angular 4 is a JavaScript framework for building web applications and apps in JavaScript, html, and TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript. Angular provides built-in features for animation, http service, and materials which in turn has features such as auto-complete, navigation, toolbar, menus, etc. The code is written in TypeScript, which compiles to JavaScript and displays the same in the browser.
The structure of Angular is based on the components/services architecture. AngularJS was based on the model view controller. 
AngularJS is based on the model view controller, whereas Angular is based on the components structure. Angular uses TypeScript.

Environment Setup :
Nodejs - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
	C:\>node –v
Npm
	C:\>npm –v
Angular CLI - https://cli.angular.io/
	npm install –g @angular/cli@latest
	ng -v
IDE VSCODE - https://code.visualstudio.com/

First angular application :
1. npm install –g @angular/cli@latest
2. ng new my-dream-app // name of the project which creates default application of angular
3. cd my-dream-app
4. Start the ng server - 
The ng serve command builds the application and starts the web server.
ng serve 
http://localhost:4200/
ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 –port 4205
http://localhost:4205/

Project Structure :

e2e − end to end test folder. Mainly e2e is used for integration testing and helps ensure the application works fine.

node_modules − The npm package installed is node_modules. You can open the folder and see the packages available.

src − This folder is where we will work on the project using Angular

angular.json − It basically holds the project name, version of cli, etc.

.editorconfig − This is the config file for the editor.

.gitignore − A .gitignore file should be committed into the repository, in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that clone the repository.

karma.conf.js − This is used for unit testing via the protractor. All the information required for the project is provided in karma.conf.js file.

package.json − The package.json file tells which libraries will be installed into node_modules when you run npm install.

protractor.conf.js − This is the testing configuration required for the application.

tsconfig.json − This basically contains the compiler options required during compilation.

tslint.json − This is the config file with rules to be considered while compiling.

Source Folder Structure :
The src folder is the main folder, which internally has a different file structure.
app folder :
It contains the files described below. These files are installed by angular-cli by default.

app.module.ts − If you open the file, you will see that the code has reference to different libraries, which are imported. Angular-cli has used these default libraries for the import – angular/core, platform-browser. 
The names itself explain the usage of the libraries. They are imported and saved into variables such as declarations, imports, providers, and bootstrap.
